## Folder description

- laserMicroscope: folder which containts the codes used to analyze the laser microscope (VK-X3000) data

- vk4reader: library implemented using this [code](https://github.com/torkian/vk4-python-driver.git). The data from the microscope is in .vk4 format and this library helps opening up those files. To install the library run the following commands:
    - Download the folder and place it in `~`
    - Execute `python3 -m pip install -e ~/vk4reader --user`
    - Test the installation with `python3 -c "import vk4reader; print(vk4reader.__file__)"` from which you should get something like `~/vk4reader/vk4reader/__init__.py`
    - Once installed, you can load it in your analysis programs (as it is done in the file under `laserMicroscope/basicPlot.py`)
